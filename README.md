# Gulp
I made a simple gulp file and a short guide to use it with projects involving Sass and Javascript! This is meant to be a simple and easy guide to help people breach the gap between starting to learn Front-end coding and learning to work with these technologies in real projects.


To use this it is recommended you install node.js as this comes with npm which is required to use this without isues.

Select the most recent recommeneded version.

Download the .zip and drop this into where you will be working on your front-end project.
Then open your console when you copied these file and type the following to install all default packages.

```
npm install
```

I will go into more advance things which can be done with this project such as adding other packages and how to use what is already in the gulpfile.js. This can be found in the Wiki.
